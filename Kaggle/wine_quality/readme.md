> # Data Set Information:

>> The dataset was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
Two datasets were combined and few values were randomly removed.

> # Attribute Information:
>> For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1. Type: Red and White wine types;
2. Fixed acidity: Most acids involved in wine are either fixed or non-volatile (does not evaporate quickly);
3. Volatile acidity: amount of acetic acid in wine, which at very high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste;
4. Citric acid: Found in small amounts, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines;
5. Residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it is rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with more than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet;
6. Chlorides: Amount of salt in the wine;
7. Free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and the bisulfite ion; prevents microbial growth and wine oxidation;
8. Total sulfur dioxide: Number of free and bound forms of S02; at low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations above 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and flavor of the wine;
9. Density: Density of the liquid is close to that of water, depending on the percentage of alcohol and sugar;
10. pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale of 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale;
11. Sulphates: wine additives that can contribute to sulfur dioxide (S02) gas levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant;
12. Alcohol: Percentage of alcohol content of the wine;
13. Quality: Score between 0 and 10 (based on sensory data) - Output variable;
